weights:
  weight_mode: core_mantle_crust # core_mantle_crust: use the three layer earth model, which considers the different densities of the core, mantle and crust. simple: use the simple earth model, which apply a constant earth density
  
noise: False  # specify if simulation should be run with or without noise
sampling_rate: 5.  # sampling rate in GHz used internally in the simulation. At the end the waveforms will be downsampled to the sampling rate specified in the detector description
  
speedup:
  minimum_weight_cut: 1.e-5
  delta_C_cut: 0.698  # 40 degree

propagation:
  ice_model: ARAsim_southpole
  attenuate_ice: True # if True apply the frequency dependent attenuation due to propagating through ice. (Note: The 1/R amplitude scaling will be applied in either case.)
  n_freq: 25  # the number of frequencies where the attenuation length is calculated for. The remaining frequencies will be determined from a linear interpolation between the reference frequencies. The reference frequencies are equally spaced over the complet frequency range. 
  
signal:
  model: Alvarez2000
  zerosignal: False  # if True, the signal is set to zero. This is useful to study 'noise' only simulations
  polarization: auto # can be either 'auto' or 'custom'
  ePhi: 1.  # only used if 'polarization = custom', fraction of ePhi component
  eTheta: 0.  # only used if 'polarization = custom', fraction of eTheta component
  
trigger:
  noise_temperature: 300  # in Kelvin
  bandwidth: null  # null or floaat in GHz (the effective bandwidth. It is used to calculate the Vrms from the noise temperature. If None, the bandwidth is calculated from the sampling rate assuming that the bandwidth is 0Hz to the Nyquist frequency

save_all: False # if True, save all events
