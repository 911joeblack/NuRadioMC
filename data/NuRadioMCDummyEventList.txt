# standard event list format of NuRadioMC (adapted from ARASim)
# the very first line defines the file version, all other lines represent the events
# each row specifies one event
# all quantities are in the default NuRadioMC units (i.e., meters, radians and eV)
# all geometry quantities are in the NuRadioMC default local coordinate system:
#     coordinate origin is at the surface
#     x axis is towards Easting, y axis towards Northing, z axis upwards
#     zenith/theta angle is defined with respect to z axis, i.e. 0deg = upwards, 90deg = towards horizon, 180deg = downwards
#     azimuth/phi angle counting northwards from East
# 
# the collumns are defined as follows
# 1. event id (integer)
# 2. neutrino flavor (string, one of ['e', 'mu', 'tau'])
# 3. particle or antiparticle (string, one of ['nu', 'nubar'])
# 4. energy of neutrino (double)
# 5. charge or neutral current interaction (string, one of ['cc', 'nc']
# 6./7./8. position of neutrino interaction vertex in cartesian coordinates (x, y, z) (in default NuRadioMC local coordinate system)
# 9. zenith/theta angle of neutrino direction (pointing into direction of propagation)
# 10. azimuth/phi angle of neutrino direction (pointing into direction of propagation)
# 11. inelasticity (the fraction of neutrino energy that goes into the hadronic part)
