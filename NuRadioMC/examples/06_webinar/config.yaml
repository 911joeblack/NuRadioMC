# We will add noise to our signals. Keep in mind that this will cause some events
#Â to trigger on noise. To study the number of fortuitious triggers, setting
# zerosignal: True will perform a simulation with noise only.
noise: True

# This controls the electric field model that is used
signal:
  # We recommend the Alvarez2009 model for the simulation of effective volumes
  # For reconstruction purposes, where accuracy is most needed, we recommend the
  # ARZ2020 model.

# There is a variety of ice models we can choose from.
propagation:
  # For the refractive index, there are: greenland_simple, mooresbay_simple,
  # southpole_2015, southpole_simple, and ARAsim_southpole. See utilities.medium
  # to know their refractive index profile.

  # We have three available attenuation models: GL1 for Greenland, MB1 for
  # Moore's Bay, and SP1 for South Pole.

# Usually, we save only the events that have triggered. For this example, however,
# we are going to save all the events in the input file after they have been processed.
